# SudokuSolver
Initial Implementation: Implements backtracking search algorithm using MRV and degree heuristics for the variable selection process to solve a given sudoku problem by the user. Algorithm's efficiency was improved by inferencing during search and preprocessing prior to search.

Revised Implementation: Original implementatation of this approach is credited to Dante Sblendorio. Takes an iterative approach to solving the sudoku puzzle. Needed to add functions to the original implementation that check if the input puzzle was valid and if the final puzzle was solved. In addition, needed to add a function that flattens the 2D numPy array to a 1D array
